# Countries List
This is a small appilcation showing list of countries and brief information about each of them.
I've used MVVM approach with android data binding as my core architecture. The other option was to use a little more 
classic MVP approach based on clean architecture, but I decided to try the new android data binding with MVVM.

I've used Retrofit for API calls, Rx with Reltrolambda, Picasso for image loading and Junit with Mockito for Unit testing.

Regarding UX - I've tried to make it simple, but look nice with a help of Shared Elements Animation and Constraint Layout.
